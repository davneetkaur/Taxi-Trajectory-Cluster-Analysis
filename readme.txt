The project folder contains all the source code for the application as well as the dataset (mex_clean.csv)

To run the project, the dataset needs to be imported in mongoDB (steps included in project report)
Once the data is imported in the mongodb, the app.py file can be used to start the localhost using the command:

	python app.py

After starting the server, the application can be accessed at:

	http://localhost:5000/
